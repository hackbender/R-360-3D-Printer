#R-360-3D-Printer

First open source polar RepRap 3d printer.  

This project is being revived after 5 years without changes.  Plans involve optimizing and replacing poor quality cad files with new SolidWorks and 3MF models that retain original functionality but have improved fitment, durability, and printability.  Any additional information about the orginal unit would be helpful!
